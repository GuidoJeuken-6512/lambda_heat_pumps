## Features Overview

The integration includes several robustness features designed to handle various failure scenarios:

- **Individual Reads**: Problematic registers are read individually instead of in batches
- **Dynamic Timeout Adjustment**: Sensor-specific timeouts based on register performance
- **Multi-Client Anti-Synchronization**: Prevents Modbus conflicts in multi-client environments
- **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Temporarily stops operations to failing services
- **Exponential Backoff**: Intelligent retry logic with jitter
- **Offline Data Handling**: Persists last known values during network outages

## Configuration

All robustness features are configured in `const.py`:

```python
# Modbus Configuration
LAMBDA_MODBUS_TIMEOUT = 3        # Base Modbus timeout in seconds
LAMBDA_MAX_RETRIES = 3           # Maximum retry attempts
LAMBDA_RETRY_DELAY = 5           # Delay between retries in seconds

# Register-specific Timeouts (absolute addresses)
LAMBDA_REGISTER_TIMEOUTS = {
    0: 1,     # Register 0 - very short timeout (well under HA 10s limit)
    1050: 1,  # Register 1050 - very short timeout (batch read problems)
    1060: 1,  # Register 1060 - very short timeout (batch read problems)
}

# Individual Reads for problematic registers (absolute addresses)
LAMBDA_INDIVIDUAL_READ_REGISTERS = [0, 1050, 1060]  # Read individually

# Low Priority Registers (read last)
LAMBDA_LOW_PRIORITY_REGISTERS = [0, 1050, 1060]     # Low priority

# Multi-client Modbus Configuration
LAMBDA_MULTI_CLIENT_SUPPORT = True
LAMBDA_BASE_UPDATE_INTERVAL = 60  # Base interval in seconds
LAMBDA_RANDOM_INTERVAL_RANGE = 5  # Random deviation ¬±5 seconds
LAMBDA_MIN_INTERVAL = 45          # Minimum interval
LAMBDA_MAX_INTERVAL = 75          # Maximum interval

# Circuit Breaker Configuration
LAMBDA_CIRCUIT_BREAKER_ENABLED = True
LAMBDA_CIRCUIT_BREAKER_FAILURE_THRESHOLD = 3  # Open after 3 failures
LAMBDA_CIRCUIT_BREAKER_RECOVERY_TIMEOUT = 60  # Recovery timeout in seconds
```

## Individual Reads

### Problem
Some Modbus registers cause timeouts when read in batches, leading to "Batch read failed" errors and HA 10-second timeout warnings.

### Solution
Problematic registers are automatically read individually instead of in batches.

### Configuration
```python
# Static configuration - registers that should always be read individually
LAMBDA_INDIVIDUAL_READ_REGISTERS = [0, 1050, 1060]

# Dynamic addition - registers added at runtime based on performance
# Thresholds: 3 timeouts or 5 failures trigger individual reads
```

### How it Works
1. **Static Individual Reads**: Configured registers are immediately read individually
2. **Dynamic Addition**: Registers with repeated timeouts/failures are automatically added
3. **Performance Tracking**: System tracks timeout and failure counters per register
4. **Automatic Recovery**: Registers can be moved back to batch reads if performance improves

### Logging
```
INFO: üîß INDIVIDUAL-READ: Using individual read for register 0 - configured for individual reading
INFO: üîÑ DYNAMIC-INDIVIDUAL: Register 1000 added to Individual-Reads after 3 timeouts
```

## Timeout Management

### Problem
Home Assistant shows "Update of sensor is taking over 10 seconds" warnings when Modbus reads take too long.

### Solution
Sensor-specific timeouts that are much shorter than HA's 10-second limit.

### Configuration
```python
# Register-specific timeouts (in seconds)
LAMBDA_REGISTER_TIMEOUTS = {
    0: 1,     # error_state - 1 second timeout
    1050: 1,  # Register 1050 - 1 second timeout
    1060: 1,  # Register 1060 - 1 second timeout
}

# Base Modbus timeout
LAMBDA_MODBUS_TIMEOUT = 3  # 3 seconds for all other registers
```

### How it Works
1. **Priority Timeouts**: Critical registers get very short timeouts (1s)
2. **Fallback Timeout**: Other registers use the base timeout (3s)
3. **HA Compatibility**: All timeouts are well under HA's 10s limit
4. **Automatic Adjustment**: System can dynamically adjust timeouts based on performance

### Logging
```
INFO: ‚è±Ô∏è TIMEOUT-ADJUST: Using sensor-specific timeout 1s for register 0 - reduced from default 3s
```

## Multi-Client Anti-Synchronization

### Problem
Multiple clients accessing the same Lambda heat pump via Modbus can cause conflicts and timeouts.

### Solution
Randomized update intervals to prevent synchronized access.

### Configuration
```python
LAMBDA_MULTI_CLIENT_SUPPORT = True
LAMBDA_BASE_UPDATE_INTERVAL = 60  # Base interval in seconds
LAMBDA_RANDOM_INTERVAL_RANGE = 5  # Random deviation ¬±5 seconds
LAMBDA_MIN_INTERVAL = 45          # Minimum interval
LAMBDA_MAX_INTERVAL = 75          # Maximum interval
LAMBDA_ANTI_SYNC_ENABLED = True
LAMBDA_ANTI_SYNC_FACTOR = 0.2     # 20% jitter variation
```

### How it Works
1. **Base Interval**: All coordinators start with the same base interval (60s)
2. **Random Jitter**: Each coordinator adds random variation (¬±5s)
3. **Range Limits**: Final interval is constrained between 45-75 seconds
4. **Anti-Synchronization**: Different intervals prevent simultaneous Modbus access

### Benefits
- **Reduced Conflicts**: Clients access Lambda at different times
- **Better Performance**: Fewer Modbus collisions
- **Automatic**: No manual configuration required

## Circuit Breaker Pattern

### Problem
Repeated failures can overwhelm the system and cause cascading errors.

### Solution
Temporarily stop operations to failing services to allow recovery.

### Configuration
```python
LAMBDA_CIRCUIT_BREAKER_ENABLED = True
LAMBDA_CIRCUIT_BREAKER_FAILURE_THRESHOLD = 3  # Open after 3 failures
LAMBDA_CIRCUIT_BREAKER_RECOVERY_TIMEOUT = 60  # Recovery timeout in seconds
```

### How it Works
1. **Failure Tracking**: System counts consecutive failures
2. **Circuit Opening**: After threshold failures, circuit opens
3. **Recovery Period**: Circuit stays open for recovery timeout
4. **Automatic Recovery**: Circuit closes after successful operations

### States
- **CLOSED**: Normal operation, requests allowed
- **OPEN**: Circuit open, requests blocked
- **HALF_OPEN**: Testing recovery, limited requests allowed

## Exponential Backoff

### Problem
Immediate retries after failures can worsen the situation.

### Solution
Intelligent retry logic with increasing delays and jitter.

### Configuration
```python
LAMBDA_MAX_RETRIES = 3      # Maximum retry attempts
LAMBDA_RETRY_DELAY = 5      # Base delay between retries
```

### How it Works
1. **Exponential Delays**: Each retry waits longer (5s, 10s, 20s)
2. **Jitter**: Random variation prevents thundering herd
3. **Maximum Cap**: Delays are capped at 30 seconds
4. **Minimum Delay**: Delays never go below 1 second

### Retry Sequence
- **Attempt 1**: Immediate
- **Attempt 2**: 5s ¬± 20% jitter
- **Attempt 3**: 10s ¬± 20% jitter
- **Attempt 4**: 20s ¬± 20% jitter

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### HA 10-Second Timeout Warnings
**Symptoms**: `WARNING: Update of sensor is taking over 10 seconds`

**Solutions**:
1. Check if register is in `LAMBDA_INDIVIDUAL_READ_REGISTERS`
2. Verify timeout is set in `LAMBDA_REGISTER_TIMEOUTS`
3. Increase update interval in `LAMBDA_BASE_UPDATE_INTERVAL`

#### Batch Read Failures
**Symptoms**: `ERROR: Batch read failed for 1050-1060`

**Solutions**:
1. Add problematic registers to `LAMBDA_INDIVIDUAL_READ_REGISTERS`
2. Check if registers are in `LAMBDA_LOW_PRIORITY_REGISTERS`
3. Verify Modbus connection stability

#### Circuit Breaker Open
**Symptoms**: `DEBUG: Circuit breaker is OPEN - skipping Modbus read`

**Solutions**:
1. Wait for recovery timeout period
2. Check network connectivity
3. Verify Lambda heat pump is responding

### Debugging

#### Enable Debug Logging
```python
# In const.py
LAMBDA_DEBUG_MODE = True
```

#### Check Individual Reads
```python
# Look for these log messages:
INFO: üîß INDIVIDUAL-READ: Using individual read for register X
INFO: üîÑ DYNAMIC-INDIVIDUAL: Register X added to Individual-Reads
```

#### Monitor Timeout Adjustments
```python
# Look for these log messages:
INFO: ‚è±Ô∏è TIMEOUT-ADJUST: Using sensor-specific timeout Xs for register Y
```

## Performance Monitoring
